<h2>Guitar Classifier</h2>

<p>Jupiter notebook is used for training and testing a classifier model for differentiating between acoustic and electric guitar images. Tensorflow was the machine learning library used.</p>

<p>The images (dataset) of acoustic and electric guitars available in the repository.</p>

<p>A pre-trained suitable image classifier model (Inception V3) was selected.</p>

<p>In the Jupyter Notebook the steps taken are:
<ul>
<li> read and prepare the dataset</li>
<li> train the classifier using transfer learning</li>
<li> test the modelâ€™s performance</li>
</ul>
